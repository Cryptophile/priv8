# Priv8 - Privacy & Security Resources
This is a list of resources such as whitepapers, guides, tools & applications, along with various other things relating to privacy and security.

#### Tips:
* Do not link your online identity and personal identity together.
* Do not cross-post content on multiple accounts.
* Use different usernames and passwords for every site you're one.
* When choosing a password use special characters, uppercase & lowercase characters, numbers, and even spaces. It also helps if it is over 12+ characters.
* Remove all EXIF data before posting images online.
* When using Tor, if you're doing anything that may put you at risk, change your Tor circuit every 30 minutes to an hour.
* Set all forums accounts to disable others from viewing when you're online.
* Disable or remove all unnecessary services, programs, etc.
* If you're using a phone with the ability to pull the battery out, do so before leaving it unattended.
* Place a sticker or piece of tape over your camera.
* Do not post any identifying information online. (Name, email, address, etc.)
* Do not post usernames to your social accounts online, do so in private.
* Keep all software and system packages up to date.
* Use common typography, don't use slangs or things such as: omfg, lol, omg, etc.
* Do not use contractions such as "don't".
* Do not start a sentence with and, or, but. Instead use furthermore, however, and alternatively. 
* Never use big letters in this fashion: NO, SERIOUSLY, DO NOT.
* Do not use "anybody", instead use "someone or anyone"
* Use their, they're, and there correctly.
